# SWE-PROJECT


Project work of the course software engineering on the University of Debrecen.
This application is an OpenJFX game named HorseGame. 
It would be a board game with two players who control their own characters. The movement of the characters would be similar to the movement of a horse in chess. 
The main goal of the game is to lay 5 "tiles" on the field in a row or column.
